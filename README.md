I live in Saratoga Springs UT and am getting my Degree in Applied Technology.  I have been married to my wonderful wife for 15 years.  We have 5 kids with number 6 due in the next couple of weeks.  I stay really busy but wouldnt have it any other way.  When I do find free time, I enjoy riding motorcycles and driving RC trucks.
